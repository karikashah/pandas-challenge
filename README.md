Here are my key observations:

```
1. Charter schools with lesser # of kids have better passing rates than district schools
2. Overall irrespective of school type & grades, the math passing score is lower than reading passing score
3. There is a significance drop in % passing Math for:
    - District level schools vs Charter (66% vs 94%) also, 
    - When school size is bigger i.e. large size (2000-5000) vs. small size (<1000), & 
    - When average spending per student is more than $645. 
```
# Things to do before you run the main.py
1. Stand at PyCity folder level then create a "Python Resources" folder 2 levels above, from the main.py file  
2. Make sure you have schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv files in "Python Resources" folder.
3. Then run the main.py from PyCity folder file
